# Wizardry

Wizardry is a simple text-based adventure engine where players can explore multiple rooms by typing movement commands (north, east, south, west), 
pick up and drop items, manage an inventory, and save/load their game progress. 

The system was built in C++, featuring an object-oriented design for rooms, objects, and game state.
